## ✨ Overview

**Hit The Grounds Draw** is a modern, high-performance web application designed to automate the grouping process for the HTG 2025 cricket tournament. It features a constraint-satisfaction algorithm to ensure fair play by preventing teams from the same organization from being placed in the same group.

Built with a focus on **aesthetics** and **user experience**, the app delivers a "wow" factor with smooth animations, glassmorphism effects, and a sleek dark theme.
